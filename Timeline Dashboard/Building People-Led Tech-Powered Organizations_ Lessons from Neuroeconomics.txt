Building People-Led, Tech-Powered Organizations: Lessons from Neuroeconomics
By Tolliver Davis
Senior Manager, Sam’s Club People Strategy
As organizations embrace artificial intelligence, most focus on efficiency and automation. At Sam’s Club, we are asking a different question: how can AI act with intentionality, helping people make better decisions, grow, and thrive?
Our vision is not about automating tasks alone. We are building agentic AI: systems that take initiative, adapt to new information, and collaborate meaningfully with humans.
To guide us, we are drawing on an unexpected discipline: neuroeconomics, the study of how people make decisions shaped by cognition, emotion, and motivation.
At first glance, neuroeconomics and AI may seem far apart. Together, they provide a blueprint for designing intelligent systems that go beyond processing data and begin to understand people.
From Automation to Agency
Traditional automation is rule-based and reactive. It waits for a command, executes, and delivers. Agentic AI is fundamentally different. It can set goals, weigh tradeoffs, and respond to feedback. In short, it begins to mirror human agency.
That evolution raises critical questions:
* How do we ensure AI decisions align with human values?
* How do we build trust in systems that think for themselves?
* How do we design AI that elevates, rather than overwhelms, human capability?
Neuroeconomics helps us answer. It offers the cognitive, emotional, and social architecture of decision-making. This framework allows us to build AI that is psychologically aware, emotionally intelligent, and behaviorally aligned.
What This Looks Like at Sam’s Club
We are embedding agentic AI into systems that support thousands of associates. These agents must do more than complete tasks. They must coach, advise, and evolve with the people they serve.
* Merchandising: AI that recommends localized assortments by blending sales data, seasonality, shopper mood, and manager input.
* Operations: AI that guides managers through labor planning with clear tradeoff options, instead of raw data overload.
* Learning & Development: AI that nudges associates to invest in long-term skills, countering the natural pull of short-term convenience.
Each of these examples reflects neuroeconomic truths about human behavior. Ignoring those truths leads to systems that frustrate users. Embracing them produces AI that becomes a trusted partner.
Designing Responsibly
People are social learners. We want to feel seen, supported, and empowered. Agentic AI must therefore act as social agents: systems that know when to explain, when to adapt, and when to defer.
Responsible design requires transparency, fairness, and human oversight from the beginning. By anchoring our systems in the science of decision-making, we are not just keeping people involved. We are centering empathy, cognition, and collaboration in every design choice.
The Bigger Picture
This moment is about more than technology. It is about trust, transformation, and the kind of organization we choose to be.
At Sam’s Club, our goal is bold and clear: use AI not to replace human decision-making, but to elevate it. By blending the science of how people behave with the technical power of AI, we are creating digital agents that empower people, not overpower them.
Neuroeconomics provides a roadmap for the future. The best AI will not only be powerful; it will also be human-aware.
